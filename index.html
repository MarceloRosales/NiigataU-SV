      The Niigata University Short Stay Visit Program (SSVP) invites students from Niigata University's <b>PARTNER INSTITUTIONS*</b> to experience not only the academic environment at the dental faculty, but also a variety of cultural and social events that help students feel welcome on our campus.
      (*Universities with especial exchange agreements)
      <br>
      <br>
      SSVP students stay at the university's residential facilities or in accommodations near by the campus. Students will be able to take seminars and classes alongside other international students and participate in a variety of extracurricular programs and events that are open to the community.
      <br>
      <br>
      We are eager to learn about the unique insights visiting students bring from their universities, and we are happy to incorporate them in our academic community.
      <br>
      <br>

        <br>
        <p>As of July 2017, Japan has taken measures concerning the Visa Exemption Arrangements with 68 countries and regions.</p>
        <p>Nationals and citizens of those countries and regions shown in this <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html" target="_blank"><b>list</b></a> are <b>not required</b> to obtain visas to enter Japan when their visits are tourism, commerce, conferences, visiting relatives/ acquaintances, etc. </p>
        <p><b>Period of Stay: </b><br>
          The period of stay granted at the time of the landing permission will be "15 days" for Brunei, Indonesia, and Thailand, and "30 days" for United Arab Emirates. For other countries and regions will be "90 days".</p>
        <p>However, when foreign nationals engage in paid activities in Japan, or their periods of stay exceed those stipulated in each country's arrangement of short-term stay, visas will be required to enter Japan.</p>
        <p><b>Visa procedure</b></p>
        <p>Due to the complex nature of visa requirements, we advise you to contact the Consular Section of the Embassy or Consulate General of Japan nearest you for more information and advice.</p>

        <div id="Travel-Insurance"><h2>Travel Insurance</h2></div>
        <br>
        <p><b>Why you need travel insurance for Japan?</b></p>
        <p>A travel insurance will cover medical care should you become sick or have an accident while in Japan. This is not because medical care is particularly expensive in Japan. Of course, if you need serious care, long-term hospitalization or surgery, the costs can add up quickly and having a good travel insurance policy can save you money.</p>
        <p>We recommend buying travel insurance before you come to Japan. Be sure to get a policy that covers not only medical care, but also lost luggage, cancelled hotel and plane tickets, and damage or stolen gear (although theft in Japan is extremely rare, it does occasionally happen).</p>
        <p>Alternatevily, it is possible to buy a travel insurance in Japan, however prices might be higher.</p>
        <p>In case of any health emergency, Dr. Ishida will indicate the apporpriate medical venue and insurance procedure.</p>

        <p><b>Proof of Insurance Required</b></p>
        <p>The main reason to have a valid travel insurance while traveling in Japan is so that you can show your proof of insurance to the people at a clinic or hospital where you hope to receive care. Because Japan has a national health insurance system that covers almost all the residents of the country, they are leery of treating foreign patients who don't belong to this system. Sadly, there have been many instances of clinics and hospitals turning away foreign patients who needed care, even some with life-threatening conditions. Having proof of insurance is usually enough to overcome any reluctance on the part of the clinic or hospital to give care.</p>
        <p><b>What to look for in a Travel Insurance Policy?</b></p>
        <p>Before you buy a travel insurance, check the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Valid in Japan: Obviously, the plan you purchase must be valid in Japan.</li>
          <li>Cancellation coverage: Make sure that the policy will cover cancelled hotel reservations and plane tickets etc.</li>
          <li>Full medical coverage and evacuation coverage: The plan should cover all potential medical expenses (less the deductible or excess), including ambulance transport, in- and outpatient care, hospitalization and, where necessary, evacuation back to your home country.</li>
          <li>Lost, stolen or damaged gear or luggage: Make sure the plan you intend to buy covers these things. As you can imagine, theft is rare in Japan, but it does happen. Like anywhere else, things can be easily lost or damaged. This is especially important if you're traveling with things like computers and expensive cameras.</li>
          <li>Dangerous activity coverage or exclusion: If you plan to do some skiing, rock climbing, mountain climbing, trekking, scuba diving or the like while in Japan, make sure the plan you intend to purchase includes coverage for accidents incurred while participating in these activities.</li>
          <li>Proof of insurance: Make sure the plan you purchase will provide you with some form of hardcopy proof of insurance. As discussed above, if you seek care at a hospital or clinic, having a physical document showing that you are insured can mean the difference between receiving treatment and being turned away.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="Packing-advice"><h2>Packing advice</h2></div>
        <br>
        <p><b>Bring shoes that are easy to slip on and off</b></p>
        <p>It's wise to bring shoes that slip on and off easily, many places in Japan - including ryokans (traditional inns), temples, and many izakayas and restaurants - require you to remove your shoes before entering.</p>
        <p>As a rule of thumb, if you see tatami mats, you'll need to take off your shoes. (In these cases, it's also considered somewhat impolite to be barefoot, so if needed bring a pair of socks with you!).</p>
        <p>Depending on your itinerary, it's usually also wise to bring comfortable walking shoes.</p>

        <p><b>Pack as lightly as possible</b></p>
        <p>Packing lightly is a useful skill for travel to any country, but in the case of Japan it is especially worth noting. Navigating Japan is much easier when you have a small, easily-portable bag or suitcase.</p>
        <p>Most travelers in Japan rely heavily on Japan's comprehensive and easy-to-use railway networks, but unfortunately Japanese trains and train stations do not cater to travelers with a lot of luggage.</p>
        <p>The shinkansen (bullet train) typically has a small dedicated area for suitcases, but space is at a premium and it is not wise to bank on easily finding a spot for your massive suitcase. On the other hand, the shinkansen's overhead space is just right for small carry-on sized suitcases.</p>
        <p>As for other (non-shinkansen) trains in Japan: while some do have some space overhead for small bags, many have none at all.</p>
        <p>For all of these reasons, we recommend traveling either with a small rolling suitcase (or backpack), if at all possible.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the heavy packers, takuhaibin - Japan's incredible luggage-forwarding system - means you don't necessarily have to.</p>
        <p>Takuhaibin (also known as takkyubin) is a fast, reasonable, and very reliable service that allows you to easily and efficiently send suitcases to your accomodations.</p>
        <p>While in some instances same-day forwarding is possible (for a premium), delivery between most destinations within Japan takes one or two nights, which means spending a night or two without your main luggage.</p>
        <p><b>How to use takuhaibin?:</b> See <a href="https://boutiquejapan.com/luggage-forwarding/" target="_blank">Luggage Forwarding in Japan.</a></p>

        <div id="Wear-and-Dress"><h2>Wear and Dress code</h2></div>
        <br>
        <p>If you enjoy dressing casually, you should be fine in almost all situations. If you have a special occasion (for example, a party or special dinner) then you should dress accordingly. Typically, formal attire is not required, apart from in formal or business situations. However, we recommend using your best judgment, dressing respectfully, and common-sense dress code regulations: no baseball caps, flip flops, shorts, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Hospital, clinics and laboratories</b></p>
        <p>For the clinic and laboratories, the use of white coats or scrubs are a requirement. Since you are attending the clinic we suggest you to bring a long white coat with long sleeves. For other activities, there are no real dress code that I am aware of.</p>
        <p>If you need to use scarf or other garments for religious reasons you may do so as long as it does not affect the work environment, as an example, you cannot wear the scarf in the animal facility since you are required to use a special garment provided by the facility.</p>
        <p><b>Washing machine</b></p>
        <p>For those whom are staying at the Kouraku Kainkan washing machine is not available at the facility, however the university arranged the use of the washing machine at the university building.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Japan is famous for the beauty of its four very distinct seasons, and it is essential to pack accordingly.</p>
        <p>This is a good general overview of month-by-month temperatures in Japan but because each year varies, the best thing to do is check weather forecasts a couple of weeks before your trip. Any weather site will do.</p>
        <p>If you're traveling to various parts of Japan, make sure to check the forecast for each place you'll be visiting, as the weather can vary drastically between different parts of the country.</p>

        <p id="internet"><b>Internet Connection</b></p>

        <p>For SSVP students, Internet connection is available through the Dental School's Wi-Fi service and the accommodations outside the University Campus (Hotel's WiFi). However, there is no Wi-Fi service at the accommodation facilities inside the campus (Kouraku Kaikan). Hence, we recommend to acquire a <b>Pocket Wi-Fi device or Cellular SIM card data Plan.</b></p>
        <p>Wi-Fi in Japan is not nearly as widespread as most people imagine (read more about <a href="https://boutiquejapan.com/wifi-and-mobile/" target="_blank">Wi-Fi and mobile in Japan</a>). Even if you don't plan to check email or upload photos, being able to use Google and Google Maps while out and about exploring is essential!</p>
        <p>Pocket Wi-Fi and Cellular SIM cards are available in many phone and electronic shops (like Bic-Camera and Yodobashi); there are a wide range of prices and plans to choose.</p>

        <br>
        <p id="WiFi"><b>Wi-Fi connection</b></p>
        <p>To use Wi-Fi in our dental school, you are required to submit the "Wi-Fi ADDRESS or mac address" of your phone or tablet (in advance if possible). Regarding laptop PCs, only devices with the latest ANTIVIRUS updates will be allowed to connect. Keep in mind that the Wi-Fi router will be sheared with all the international students, if the system detects a virus in any of the connected devices, it will shut down the router and no one will be allowed to connect until all devices are checked and cleared.</p>
        <p>Please send the "Wi-Fi ADDRESS" or a screenshot of the information via email.</p>
        <p>If you don't know how to retrieve the address information, we will help you at your arrival on campus.</p>

        <br>
        <p id="Travel-adapter"><b>Travel adapter</b></p>
        <p>Most of Japan's electrical outlets are 2-pronged "Type A" (100 Volt, 50-60 Hz), so if you have a device with a 3-pronged or other-style plug, you may need a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N78TDF1/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01N78TDF1&linkCode=as2&tag=boutjapatravc-20&linkId=393953bb41b84cb06676ccf630e3dc98" target="_blank">travel adapter</a>. Many electronic devices (such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) already have transformers, which means you may not need a converter, but make sure to check your items' voltage requirements.

        <br>
        <p id="gifts"><b>Small gifts from home</b></p>
        <p>Small local gifts are wonderful for giving to professors and other people you meet along the way. <b>Tipping is not common in Japan</b>, but thoughtful gifts are always appreciated. Gifts representative of your local region or country are especially loved, e.g., a famous local product or local artisanal product.</p>

        <br>
        <div id="Travel-app"><p><b>Download a Travel App Companion</b></p></div>
        <p>The Japanese railway systems are one of the most complex and complicated railway system in the world. The best tip is to download a travel app which can suggest the navigation lines and multiple transit options for you to choose from. Google Maps and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navitime-for-japan-travel-transit-wi-fi-search/id686373726?mt=8" target="_blank">JAPAN TRAVEL</a> are good recommended apps.</p>
        <p>For Niigata city, Google maps provides reliable information on trains but not so much on buses. For the Bus system, the online page powered by <a href="http://transfer.navitime.biz/niigatabrt-newsystem/pc/map/Top" target="_blank">NAVITIME</a> provides accurate information on bus time schedule and Stops, however is not tourist friendly since the page is only in Japanese.</p>
        <p>Regarding the communication between the SSVP students, Niigata University students and coordinators, we strongly advise to download and install the <a href="https://line.me/en/" target="_blank">LINE</a>  application in your phone. In japan, Line app is the most popular application for messaging and communication, almost all Japanese student at Niigata university use it, making it a very convenient tool. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Most trains are run by the Japan Railway (JR) company but some railways, especially in other regions, are run by private companies. Railway trains usually cover longer routes and serve most suburban areas in Japan. You also have the option to take the subway trains for routes not covered by railway trains. In Tokyo for example, the subway system is run by Tokyo Metro and the Toei Subway. Take note that a single train company usually runs multiple lines or routes with fixed ticket prices. But if you transfer to another line run by a different company, chances are you will have to pay more fee for the ticket.</p>
        <p>In Niigata however, there are only trains (JR) and buses (no subways).</p>

        <p id="JR-Pass"><b>Japan Rail Pass</b></p>
        <p>The Japan Rail Pass (also commonly called JR Pass) is a very cost-effective rail pass for long distance train travel in Japan. It can be used by foreign tourists only, and offers unlimited use of JR trains for one, two or three weeks at a cost that residents of Japan can only dream of. The pass comes in two types: ordinary and green car. The latter is valid on green cars (first class cars) that offer more spacious seats than ordinary cars.</p>
        <p>If you are planning to have long distance travels to visit other cities or regions during your stay in Japan we highly recommend the JR Pass.</p>

        <p>This is the most ideal way to save money for your transportation expenses. These rechargeable prepaid cards can be used to conveniently pay for your train fares among others. Japan has several (10) popular IC cards including Suica- the IC card by JR trains, and Pasmo- the IC card of Tokyo's railway, subway and operators other than JR, which you can use in almost all trains and subways in most of Japan's cities. These IC cards are convenient to use, as you will only touch the card onto the card readers in stations' ticket gates, and your fare will be deducted automatically.</p>
        <p>In Niigata city, Suica card can be used for the trains and the buses as well. Thus, it is our recommendation for Niigata.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Buying a train ticket or "kippu" is easy. Keep in mind that not all tickets work in lines run by different railway or subway companies. When purchasing a ticket, make sure to use the right ticket machine. However, most train stations can be confusing, <b>do not hesitate to ask</b> where to buy a ticket (kippu wa doko ni kaimasu ka?) and how to get into your platform. Stations have excellent customer service ready to assist you if ask for help.</p>

        <div id="local-bus-ticket"><p><b>Buying a local bus ticket </b></p></div>
        <br>
        <p>Using buses in Japan can be intimidating to foreigners because there are different ticketing systems depending on the company and recognizing the stop that you want to get off can be challenging. While some bus companies do a good job at providing English signage, timetables and announcements, many buses lack any English information, altogether. </p>
        <p>Below is a description of the most common system, followed by notes about exceptions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Enter the bus through the <b>back door</b>.</li>
          <li>When entering, pick up a ticket from a small machine next to the door. A number is printed on the ticket (usually the bus stop number), which you will later use to determine your fare. Do NOT lose this ticket, otherwise the bus driver will charge the fare from the start of the bus line. If you use an IC card to pay the fare, touch your card against the sensor.</li>
          <li>A display above the driver shows the next stop and the fares for that stop in yen. To determine your fare, match the number on your ticket with the number and fare on the display. If you use an IC card, then you do not have to worry about this.</li>
          <li>When your stop is approaching, press one of the buttons on the wall to signal the driver that you wish to get off at the next stop, and prepare the <b>exact fare money.</b></li>
          <li>Exit the bus through the <b>front door</b>. If you do not have the exact fare, use the <b>changing machine</b> to get small coins.</li>
          <li>When getting off, put your ticket and the exact fare into the box next to the driver. If you use an IC card, touch the card against the reader near the driver.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In many cities or city centers, for example in central Kyoto, a flat fare applies, i.e. you always pay the same price regardless of how far you travel. This means that you do not have to worry about steps 2) and 3) in the above description.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are a few exceptions to the above outlined system. The most prominent exception are buses where you are supposed to enter through the front door, pay a flat fare when entering, and exit through the rear door, for example, city buses in Tokyo.</p>

        <div id="Highway-Buses"><h2>Highway Buses</h2></div>
        <br>
        <p>Highway buses (高速バス, kōsoku bus) are an inexpensive alternative to trains for long and medium distance travel in Japan. On longer distances many highway buses travel overnight. While buses tend to be slower than express trains, they are usually considerably cheaper. Especially on competitive routes, discount fares have dropped to very low levels. There is also the Japan Bus Pass which allows for very cheap bus travel.</p>
        <h5>Bus Companies</h5>
        <br>
        <p>There exist dozens of highway bus companies in Japan, including the former state-run JR Bus companies, many regional bus companies and discount bus operators. Many of these bus operators do not maintain an English website and are difficult to use by foreign tourists. Below are some of the bus companies and services which are easy to use by foreigners:</p>
        <br>
        <p id="Willer"><b>Willer Express</b></p>
        <p><a href="http://willerexpress.com/en/?aid=184" target="_blank">Willer Express</a> is a leading discount bus operator with a wide network that allows for interregional bus travel. It is one of the few bus operators which allow online reservations in English. Willer Express also sells the <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2369.html" target="_blank">Japan Bus Pass</a>, a very cheap bus pass for foreign tourists in Japan.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="JR-Buses"><b>JR Buses</b></p>
        <p>Formerly part of the state run National Railway and now child companies of the <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2019.html" target="_blank">JR Group</a>, there are eight regional JR Bus companies, which together operate a nationwide network of highway buses: JR Hokkaido Bus, JR Tohoku Bus, JR Kanto Bus, JR Tokai Bus, Nishinihon JR Bus, Chugoku JR Bus, JR Shikoku Bus and JR Kyushu Bus.</p>
        <p>While not as cheap as discount buses, JR buses are still considerably cheaper than <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2019.html" target="_blank">express trains</a> and are relatively easy to use by foreign tourists, because tickets can be bought and seat reservations made at ticket counters at JR railway stations across Japan. In addition, <a href="https://www.kousokubus.net/JpnBus/en" target="_blank">kousokubus.net</a> allows for English online reservations of some JR highway bus lines.</p>
        <p>Until spring 2013, the <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html" target="_blank">Japan Rail Pass</a> used to be valid on a small number of JR highway bus lines, but it is now not valid on any highway bus anymore.</p>
        <p id="Japan-Bus"><b>Japan Bus Online</b></p>
        <p>Japan <a href="https://japanbusonline.com/?afcd=MDI=" target="_blank">Bus Online</a> is an English website that allows users to make online reservations for dozens of bus lines of multiple bus companies nationwide.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Even with all the people rushing to get on and off the train, it is amazing how organized and orderly the local people are when lining up the platform. No matter how in a hurry a person is, everybody stands and waits just over the line which indicates where people have to wait exactly for the train or bus door entrance. Also, it is important to remember that people should always stand behind the yellow lines of the platform; it is dangerous to stand near to the line while a fast-train is approaching, most platforms usually do not have barriers. Accidents happen occasionally, please be careful.</p>
        <p>Remember that time is of the essence in Japan, and you better be at your platform before your expected time of departure.</p>

        <p>Haneda Airport (羽田空港, Haneda Kūkō, HND), formally known as Tokyo International Airport, is located less than 30 minutes south of central Tokyo, considerably closer to the city center than Narita Airport, Tokyo's other airport. Compared to Narita Airport, Haneda Airport handles way more domestic flights, but fewer international flights. With over 60 million passengers per year overall, Haneda Airport is by far Japan's busiest airport and ranks among the world's five busiest airports.</p>
        <p>Domestic flights use the airport's two other terminals: terminal 1 is mainly used by JAL, while terminal 2 is mainly used by ANA. Free shuttle buses operate frequently between all terminal buildings (outside of the security check). Transit passengers between the domestic and international terminals may also use the monorail or Keikyu Railway for free if they get a special transit pass at the information counter. In addition, ANA and JAL operate direct buses for checked-through passengers between the secure areas of the international and their respective domestic terminals to further reduce transit times.</p>
